The EggTrayManager library is used internally by GNOME to implement the
server-side of the Notification Area (or system tray) protocol.
Gtk2::TrayManager allows you to create notification area applications using
Gtk2-Perl.

The module requires Gtk2 to be installed. But includes the code for
eggtraymanager in the distribution.
